Chapter 1

Pointville Federal Correctional Institution, New Jersey


Kurt Porter lay on a vinyl mattress inside a 
2-by-2.5-meter precast concrete cell, listening to the
snores of two hundred fellow inmates. The digital clock
displayed four forty-five a.m. Down the hall, a convict
was locked in a nightmare and screaming for someone 
named Lashika.

In fifteen minutes Kurt would hear the rattle of keys 
and the angry clomp of Redwings as guards counted him
for the last time. At evening roll call he’d learned 
that he was being sprung six months early. No 
explanation. No reason given. It made no sense why he’d
ended up here in Pointville, and it made no sense why 
they were letting him out early. Someone wanted him 
out, he figured, and though he wasn’t unhappy about it,
he couldn’t shake the feeling that he might be entering 
a different sort of imprisonment, one he wouldn’t be 
able to just walk away from when someone said it was 
time. He also knew that on the outside he’d be 
radioactive, shit out of luck. Every Google search, as 
long as he lived and after he died, would return 
clickbait linked to keywords like “ex-con,” “hacker,” 
“notorious,” and “criminal.”

Thirty minutes later, two guards escorted Kurt to 
Receiving & Delivering, the last stop before his 
discharge. They asked him a dozen questions to make sure
he was who he said he was. Then they made him wait.

“Did my sister leave a bindle?” Kurt asked the CO. The 
man checked the screen and shook his head. “I wrote her
every week. Heard nothing back.”

“Go easy on her. They say prison is harder on the family
than the prisoner. Maybe the package got lost,” the 
officer said.

“Maybe you’re right,” Kurt said, but inside he was 
doubtful. Three months into his sentence, their mother
died of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. They let Kurt go to
the funeral, but he was flanked by guards, cuffed, and
notallowed to touch or hug anyone. It was a spectacle.
The service wasn’t even over when they packed him back
in the van and sped off. Kurt spoiled the occasion and
his sister still hadn’t forgiven him for it.

The CO handed Kurt an envelope with sixty-five dollars 
in gate money, then pressed a button that unlocked the 
door to the same lobby where eighteen months earlier he 
had first entered the prison. His plan was to take a 
bus to Port Authority, then a train to Long Island, where
he’d grown up, and see if he could find his sister and 
patch things up. Beyond that he didn’t have a plan, just 
a sinking fear that whoever had sent him to prison would 
be waiting for him.

Kurt had two bus seats to himself and dozed most of the 
way to New York City. At Port Authority he gulped down 
a Strongbow hard cider. The Taste of Freedom: If he were
an adman, that’s the tagline he’d suggest. He picked up 
an “I LOVE NY” hoodie and a pair of Walgreens 
tortoiseshell readers and walked east on 42nd Street.

The clamor of the city overwhelmed his senses; he was 
like a dog sniffing out the window of a speeding car. 
Cones and plastic tape blocked off the Bryant Park lawn
where a self-driving tractor peeled a layer of dead grass
and replaced it with squares of fresh sod. Before Kurt 
went to prison, it took six people to lay sod in the park.
Now it was a job for one. The rapid adoption of 
construction robots and self-driving vehicles was 
conspicuous, but the engineer in Kurt noticed more 
nuanced additions to the fabric of the city: There were 
sensors everywhere, experimental police-observation 
drones, and face-recognition surveillance cameras on 
every utility pole.

Pretty soon the city will run itself, Kurt thought. I 
hope it knows what it’s doing.

At Grand Central he bought a ticket to Bay Shore and 
settled into a window seat. As the doors were about to 
close, a woman with glossy lips barged in dragging a 
roller bag and fell into the seat next to Kurt’s.

They exchanged sideways glances. After a pause, the 
woman pivoted in her seat.

“Kurt?” 

He avoided her gaze. It was Anika Patel, his old 
electrical engineering professor at Urbana-Champaign. 
Not the person he expected to see, or wanted to, for 
that matter.

“You don’t remember me,” she said in a tone much 
friendlier than he remembered her ever using before. 
“Why would you? You were hungover most of the time, or 
pulling all-nighters trading Bitcoin.”

Kurt turned to look at her. A relaxed and familiar face 
smiled back.

“Anika?” he said. “Wow, this is weird. Sorry, it took me 
a second. I’ve had a long day—a long year, actually.”
Anika’s eyes reflected the dim cabin light.

“This is such a coincidence,” she said. “I was just 
talking about you last week! Someone asked me if I’d 
ever had a true prodigy as a student. I said yes—you.”

Kurt became even more uncomfortable. As the train pulled 
out he remembered the shitty grade she gave him in 3200 
but decided not to bring it up.

Anika was a year younger than Kurt but five years ahead 
academically. She was the prodigy, not Kurt. She was a 
postdoc at the time a VC-funded startup had hired away 
eight professors in one month. The provost had to 
scramble to fill the vacancies and begged her to join 
the faculty. She named her price and became the youngest 
tenured full professor in the seventy-five-year history 
of the university. It was something that always bugged 
Kurt about Anika: She’d always seemed a little too 
slick, a little too good at playing academic politics.

But he also recognized that Anika was an elite thinker. 
Her “Computer-Powered Politicians” got an ACM Knuth 
Prize nomination and put a spotlight on the shitstorm 
brewing at the intersection of machine learning and 
public policy. The treatise convinced Kurt and everyone 
else who read it that it wasn’t a question of if 
artificial intelligence would control public policy—it 
was a question of when.

Kurt was smart, too. He just didn’t know how to play 
the game like Anika did, which explained why he was 
an ex-con and Anika was an academic superstar.

“So, what have you been up to?” Anika asked, sensing 
his discomfort.

“On sabbatical,” Kurt answered. Four hours out of 
prison, that was all he could think of.

“What kind?”

“Nothing special. Just a chance to break away from my 
old routine.”

“Just as forthcoming as ever,” she said. “Let’s see what 
we can find out about you.”

As she pulled out her phone, Kurt’s neck stiffened. 
“There are tons of Kurt Porters out there,” he said. 
“Make sure you get the right one.”

“I know, I’ve done this before,” Anika said. “Oh, this 
is interesting. ‘Kurt Porter… Illicit use of proprietary 
software and three counts of interstate transportation 
of stolen property.’ Is that the right Kurt Porter? Or 
should I keep searching?”

Kurt looked away. “Guess you got me.”

“Top ten cybercriminal? Really?”

“Total bullshit,” Kurt began.

“Not according to Google.”

That struck a nerve. “Click it. You’ll see.”

Anika tapped the link but her phone lost its signal. 
“If you’re not on it, then why does Google think you 
are? Why is it linked to your name?”

“Because Google doesn’t fact-check. They put the crappy 
links at the top. Crazier it is, the better, because 
that’s what drives eyeballs: clicks and ad revenue. I 
think you’d know that better than anyone.”

Anika did know the answer better than anyone. She was 
an expert on utility functions and how smart computers 
tended to fixate on one goal. She didn’t need to be 
told Google’s utility function was to maximize ad 
revenue at any cost, including Kurt’s reputation.

“So, then, you’re completely innocent?” she asked in 
a tone that Kurt interpreted as somewhere between 
disbelief and contempt.

A rush of paranoia swarmed from the dark corners of 
Kurt’s mind like bats from a cave. Here was a former 
professor, someone he hadn’t seen in years, and one 
of the first things out of her mouth was whether or 
not he was a top ten cybercriminal. This was what his 
life was going to be like. He’d be lucky to get a job 
sweeping floors.

“Am I asking too many questions? It’s my weakness,” 
Anika said.

Kurt shook his head in a way that implied the 
conversation was over.

She changed the subject. “So, where are you going?”

“Bay Shore. Visiting my sister. At least, I think I am. 
Haven’t heard from her since they sent me away.”

“That’s weird,” Anika said. “I’m going to the same 
stop.”

The coincidences were piling up, which did nothing to 
alleviate Kurt’s general sense of unease. But he also 
had to admit that he liked talking to Anika.

“Then I’m taking the ferry from Bay Shore to Fire Island 
for a consulting gig,” she continued.

“Fire Island? What kind of consulting do you do on Fire 
Island—tutoring rich kids for their SATs?”

“Pretty boring stuff, but it pays the bills,” she said, 
then changed the subject back to him. “So, when was the 
last time you opened a compiler?”

A compiler converted human-readable instructions into 
machine code. In the arcane world they inhabited, the 
question was natural and analogous to asking a musician 
about his last gig.

“I haven’t even used a computer in eighteen months,” 
Kurt answered.  

“So you don’t know anything about 7R1B3?”

“7R1B3?”

“You know, that anonymous government automation program 
someone posted on Github two years ago.”

“Never heard of it.”

“Well, it’s blowing up.”

Kurt toyed with the hinge on his drugstore eyeglasses.

“You have a lot of catching up to do. 7R1B3 is about to 
do to government what Napster did to the music industry. 
It’s open-source, and lots of programmers are starting 
to pile on,” Anika said.

Kurt clammed up and they were silent for a few moments. 
Then she continued. “There’s a comment in the 7R1B3 
program that says the future depends on making the 
transition from human government to computer 
government.”

Kurt pretended to be disinterested. “Does it say 
that?”

“It does. And apparently a lot of people agree—
including me. Government is one of the last entities 
that hasn’t been disrupted by technology. It’s old 
and inefficient, and as far as I’m concerned, it can’t 
be modernized quickly enough.”

There was more silence until Kurt gave some ground. 
“That sounds like something people have been writing 
about for a very long time.”

“But this is different, and there are a lot of very 
powerful people who want to put this genie back in 
the bottle.”

“How would they propose doing that?”

“They would probably start by killing the guy who 
wrote it.”

“What’s that got to do with me?”

“Maybe nothing, but I just thought you might be 
interested.”
